                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p>The development of computer graphics is constantly evolving. Homages to the first
computer-generated visuals are today seen through the art style “pixel art”. Pixel art is
primarily used in game development and consists of graphics made out of distinct squares
with contrasting colors. When rendering pixel art, which is inherently low resolution, on high
resolution screens, all kinds of problems come up. Examples of such problems are distorted
pixels, choppy movement and blurry graphics. Some major game engines solve this problem
by taking shortcuts such as scaling up pixel art graphics to fit the desired resolution. This
only solves some problems and in some cases makes other issues worse. To achieve crisp
low-resolution pixel art on the whole spectrum of resolutions, new systems must be made.
Through research and experimentation, such a system has been made. The system allows for
low-resolution pixel art to remain both crisp and highly qualitative regardless of resolution.
The issue with choppy movement has also been resolved by creating an algorithm that
displaces the rendered graphics by a position dependent on the camera’s position. The system
also enables features such as procedural pixel art, which could lead to impressive graphics.
This work was done fully using C# and MonoGame but it is entirely possible to translate it
over to use in any language or framework one may desire.</p>

            <h2>Work in progress</h2>
            <p class="description">To learn more about programming as a whole, I've been developing my own game engine. The engine is based on the MonoGame framework.
                <br>
                Below are some of the main features I've currently implemented in the engine.
